 ...of aggregation as the sole mechanism causing hemocyte counts to decline with time - 


To test our experimental assumption, two samples from each group were moderately shaken after the last count, such that any free sedimented hemocytes would be resuspended. The samples were rerun directly after. This measure did not increase the number of singlet hemocytes suspended in MAS or ACB, while those in HLS further decreased (data not shown). This suggests that sedimentation is either preceded by irreversible aggregation, or that hemocytes aggregate irreversibly upon sedimentation. 

hich ruled out sedimentation as an important mechani. sm. Hemocytes did sediment with time, but this was Being the only other conceivable mechanism involved, the assumption was regarded as valid under the current experimental conditions.


Aspirate two samples from the same mussel using different buffers to confirm that the hemocyte medium in fact does not change the SSC vs. FSC profiles of the hemocyte subpopulations within 15 minute incubation. Maybe use crude hemolymph as control?
 

Report pH and osmolarity of the MAS and ACB buffer, and say that it is similar to the osmolarity of hemolymph/seawater 990 mOsm (Hartl, 2010).
- The osmolarity of MAS and ACB were adjusted to approximately 990 mOsm by the addition of \ce{NaCl}, to reflect that of \emph{M. edulis} hemolymph (Hartl, 2010)
- This could be co-presented with the fact that cells did not swell during the incubation period, deducted form the fact that the mean FCS-A did not change.

Aggregation can obscure cell type identification and the counting of single haemocytes, such that clumped haemocytes cannot be included in differentials. In addition, clumping seemed to be more severe among basophillic haemocytes, such that an exclusion of clumped haemocytes could potentially skew the differential. To bypass this problem, haemolymph was withdrawn into an equal volume of 5 \% formaldehyde in MPSS, and fixed in suspension for 1 hour. 

 On the basis of the morphological criteria in section \ref{subsection:morph}, the haemocytes where placed in one of three categories: (1) eosinophilic granulocytes, (2) basophilic granulocytes or (3) small blast-like basophils.

Since no single experiment would convey the amount of variation observed, no experiments were dedicated to characterize the subpopulations quantitatively. A quantitative approach would nor be especially interesting in itself, since the relative units of FSC and SSC vary heavily between instruments and with instrument settings. The exact light-scatter values are only meaningful when measured on the same instrument, and the insights gained from such measurements are mainly pertained to the relative light-scatter profiles of the different subpopulations.

The deviance-based R$^{2}$ is calculated to according to equation to: $R^{2} = 1 \dfrac{Residual ~ deviance}{Null ~ deviance}$. The adjusted deviance-based R$^{2}$ is calculated according to: $Adjusted ~ R^{2} = 1 - \dfrac{n-1}{n-p}(1 - R^{2})$. This was done using the \emph{adjR2()} function of the \emph{glmtoolbox} in RStudio (\cite{RStudio}).

During the initial two-hour incubation period, the percentage of necrotic haemocytes in cold MPSS did not change significantly. However, a relatively small increase of 1.18\% was observed during the final 18 hours. C
The percentage of necrotic haemocytes in cold MPSS did not increase during the first two hours of incubation, and showed only a small increase of 1.18\% during the last 18 hours (Table \ref{tb:Paired_ttests}).


Haemolymph was withdrawn from the posterior adductor muscle of 9 adult mussels into an equal volume of methanol (n=3), 3:1 methanol:glacial acetic acid (n=3) or 5\% formaldehyde in \acrshort{mpss} (n=3) and fixed for 30 minutes in suspension. The fixed haemocytes were pelleted by centrifugation (250G, 5 min, \SI{20}{\celsius}) and resuspended in the eosin component of the Hemacolor\textsuperscript{\textregistered} kit. After staining for 5, 10 or 15 minutes, the stained haemocytes were pelleted (180G, 5 min, \SI{20}{\celsius}), resuspended in 100 \micro L Sorensen buffer and transferred onto glass slides. The slides were coverslipped and inspected under brightfield illumination on a Nikon Eclipse Ni-U upright microscope with a 40x/0.75 objective.

In some adult mussels, however, the basophilic and eosinophilic granulocyte subpopulations are partly overlapping with regard to internal complexity, i.e., SSC. Since the BD Accuri C6 Plus isn't equipped with adjustable laser gain settings, these subpopulations could not be separated further instrumentally. Thus, any attempts to gate on these subpopulations based solely on light scattering profiles, would in some mussels introduce considerable uncertainty into their relative proportions. [Find the proportion of mussels where they are not well separated, and report that number instead of saying "some" mussels here.]

This is where you write about your results in the context of what was expected, what others with similar experiments have found (in line with, contradictory, similar to). Put it together with other findings that may be relevant or interesting. The results are interpreted: what do they mean for the field, the risk assessors, the environmental risk of Ti2O, ZnO Ag NPs in the aquatic environment, Trondheimsfjorden. Extrapolate to a greater level of organization?. Put the results into a bigger context.


We should have withdrawn two samples from each mussel (as we did), but one into MPSS for staining with the Hemacolor kit and subsequant MN scoring (cold MPSS, 5 min inc in humid chamber) and one into ACB for FCM assays. With a bit dilution in MPSS and short incubation, neither aggregation nor spreading is a problem.

Haemolymph smears can be messy. Therefore, scoring of necrotic and apoptotic haemocytes by microscopy should be performed by certified operators with formal education or practice from hematology or immunology. A few example PNG images with from a published protocol leaves too much to subjectivity. Secondly, if they are rare events (e.g., low dose), why not score all 10 of 100.000 cells objectively by FCM instead of 0 or 1 from 1000 cells in the smear?


\section{The role of hemocytes}
Use articles citing Friebel and Renwrantz (1995) to locate articles that have a characterized these cell-types in therms of enzyme activity and cytochemistry. (E.g. 10.1016/j.jip.2009.10.001).

Functional classification based on phagocytic capacity: Differences in phagocytosis between granulocytes and agranular haemocytes may be related to the type of phagocytosed particles involved, rather than differences in phagocytic ability (Hine, 1999)

Unlike granulocytes and hyalinocytes, precursor cells do not contribute to immune-response mechanisms such as phagocytosis or encapsulation, and they also lack common intracellular enzyme systems associated with host defence. 

Their lack of cytoplasmic organelles seems to preclude a secretory or phagocytic function

Basophilic cytoplasm suggest the presence of free ribosomes and immaturity

Refer to the 1990 study of Pipe when explaining the functions of the cytoplasmic granules.

Hemocytes also (in addition to lung and digestive gland) showed high expression levels (of initiator and executioner caspases), probably due to the role of apoptosis in the defense against pathogens. Because bivalves are highly susceptible to climate changes, pollutants and pathogens, it  could be suggested that a strong apoptotic process may be necessary to ensure body homeostasis. (Romero, 2011). See page 11 of (New Insights into the Apoptotic Process in Mollusks: Characterization of Caspase Genes in Mytilus galloprovincialis) for greater detail and references.



\section{Method}
\subsection{Animal housing}
Here, the mussels were kept to acclimatize for 2 days before transfer to the experimental exposure setup.
"were fed twice a day with a mixed diet (Chaetoceros sp. and Thalassiosira sp.). Mussels were maintained in locally-sourced seawater, which was sand-filtered and allowed to settle in the dark prior to use. Sand-filter, protein-skimmed and UV-treated."

Time of mussel harvest/purchase?

Describe water treatment in more detail: include information regarding sand-filter, protein-skimmer, 0.5 um filter bags and UV-treatment.

Because the watertreatment left no natural feed for the mussels, the filtered seawater were supplemented with algae [insert species \& frequency].


\subsection{Experimental setup/design}

storage from depuration to sampling: mussels were not kept on ice, but were washed and taken directly upstairs for measuring weight, length, height and width for condition index, and were given to us for \acrshort{fcm} sampling afterwards. If we were delayed, they were kept in the fridge until hemolymph sampling

Refer to the MN cytome assay by Bolognesi, and mention that we fixed and stained haemocytes in suspension to produce slides without aggregated haemocytes. Since the cells were dead, they did not spread or produce pseudopodia, which allowed us to observe the actual size and form which they would posses ass they flowed through the laser of the flow cytometer.

Low toxicity: Calcein/AM induced no immediate loss (3 h) of membrane integrity (10.1097/00001813-199508000-00011).


The correlation between the flow cytometric estimates and microscopic counts were tested by simple linear regression. In order to evaluate the accuracy of the gating strategy, the \acrshort{mae} of the estimates were calculated relative to the microscopic counts.

The results are presented and discussed consecutively since each subsequent section builds on the preceding.

Since Le Foll and colleagues (2010) reported that the motile properties of the different haemocyte subpopulations of \emph{M. edulis} could be used as an additional functional criteria for their characterization, the spreading behavior of the different cell types were included to expand on the morphological characteristics. This comprehended a description of the typical haemocyte shapes and motile structures that were observable under differential interference contrast illumination in spread haemocytes. The preparation of slides with spread haemocytes followed a methodology similar to that of the non-spread haemocytes, but the humid chamber incubation periods prior to fixation and staining were extended (15-30 min). Microscopic fields were examined through a 60$\times$/1.40 oil immersion objective under DIC illumination.

[This part is potentially removed if the above bridge is chosen] Their feeding strategy in particular make them highly effective in micro- and nano-scaled particle uptake (\cite{Canesi2012}), which has led to their use in a large pool of studies on the effects of engineered nanoparticles (\cite{Rocha2015}). These studies often integrate a battery of cellular and molecular biomarkers of pollutant-induced stress and immunomodulation, where the \acrshort{mumncyt} assay is included to evaluate potential cytogenotoxic effects (see e.g., \cite{Rocha2014, Ruiz2015}).

It is a suspension feeder, filtering high quantities of water for suspended particulate matter (\cite{Beyer2017b}).

\subsubsection{Differential count: granular and agranular haemocytes per 1,000} %cytometric marameters = THC and DCC
In addition to scoring cytogenic damage (MNi and NBUDs) and cytotoxic alterations (necrosis/apoptosis), the protocol includes a differential count of agranular and granular haemocytes (per 1,000).

Just a theory: Given that the blast-like cells are the precursor of both granular cell types, and chemical insult leads to increased proliferation of blast-like cells - which increases the risk of neoplastic cells (prolif rate pos. corr. to mutations). Increased recruitment/hamatopoiesis/cell turnover rate

- Seasonal variation in agranular and granular (\%) haemocytes in M. galloprovincialis (\cite{Santarem1994}). May be related to reproduction/spawning (allocation of resouses/nutrients?)

Cd:
- Decrease in eosinophilic granulocytes in response to Cd QDs, while basophils increased in response to Cd2+. (Basopils incl. blasts). Suggested limitation of QD transport by EO, since they decreases (\cite{Rocha2014}). May offer insights into the target/susceptible cell-types in NP toxicology, which may indicate possible immunomodulating effects. % M. edulis
- Increased numbers of small hyaline (blast-like) cells within the hyalinocyte sub-population of C. gigas, following exposure to 0.3 ppm cadmium ions, with a concomitant decrease in large cells (\cite{Auffret1994}). THC increased with time of exposure relative to control (2x increase). % C. gigas
- THC increased following exposure to Vibrio tubiashi after preexposure with Cd (\cite{Pipe1995}) % M. edulis



Cu2+  
- Cu2+ + Vibrio tubiashi led to sig. decrease in eosinophils compared to basophils. No such effect was observed with Cd or fluoranthene (\cite{Pipe1995}) % M. edulis
