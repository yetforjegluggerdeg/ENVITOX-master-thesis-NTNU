 ...of aggregation as the sole mechanism causing hemocyte counts to decline with time - 


 To test our experimental assumption, two samples from each group were moderately shaken after the last count, such that any free sedimented hemocytes would be resuspended. The samples were rerun directly after. This measure did not increase the number of singlet hemocytes suspended in MAS or ACB, while those in HLS further decreased (data not shown). This suggests that sedimentation is either preceded by irreversible aggregation, or that hemocytes aggregate irreversibly upon sedimentation. 

hich ruled out sedimentation as an important mechani. sm. Hemocytes did sediment with time, but this was Being the only other conceivable mechanism involved, the assumption was regarded as valid under the current experimental conditions.


Aspirate two samples from the same mussel using different buffers to confirm that the hemocyte medium in fact does not change the SSC vs. FSC profiles of the hemocyte subpopulations within 15 minute incubation. Maybe use crude hemolymph as control?
 

Report pH and osmolarity of the MAS and ACB buffer, and say that it is similar to the osmolarity of hemolymph/seawater 990 mOsm (Hartl, 2010).
- The osmolarity of MAS and ACB were adjusted to approximately 990 mOsm by the addition of \ce{NaCl}, to reflect that of \emph{M. edulis} hemolymph (Hartl, 2010)
- This could be co-presented with the fact that cells did not swell during the incubation period, deducted form the fact that the mean FCS-A did not change.

Aggregation can obscure cell type identification and the counting of single haemocytes, such that clumped haemocytes cannot be included in differentials. In addition, clumping seemed to be more severe among basophillic haemocytes, such that an exclusion of clumped haemocytes could potentially skew the differential. To bypass this problem, haemolymph was withdrawn into an equal volume of 5 \% formaldehyde in MPSS, and fixed in suspension for 1 hour. 

 On the basis of the morphological criteria in section \ref{subsection:morph}, the haemocytes where placed in one of three categories: (1) eosinophilic granulocytes, (2) basophilic granulocytes or (3) small blast-like basophils.

Since no single experiment would convey the amount of variation observed, no experiments were dedicated to characterize the subpopulations quantitatively. A quantitative approach would nor be especially interesting in itself, since the relative units of FSC and SSC vary heavily between instruments and with instrument settings. The exact light-scatter values are only meaningful when measured on the same instrument, and the insights gained from such measurements are mainly pertained to the relative light-scatter profiles of the different subpopulations.

The deviance-based R$^{2}$ is calculated to according to equation to: $R^{2} = 1 \dfrac{Residual ~ deviance}{Null ~ deviance}$. The adjusted deviance-based R$^{2}$ is calculated according to: $Adjusted ~ R^{2} = 1 - \dfrac{n-1}{n-p}(1 - R^{2})$. This was done using the \emph{adjR2()} function of the \emph{glmtoolbox} in RStudio (\cite{RStudio}).

During the initial two-hour incubation period, the percentage of necrotic haemocytes in cold MPSS did not change significantly. However, a relatively small increase of 1.18\% was observed during the final 18 hours. C
The percentage of necrotic haemocytes in cold MPSS did not increase during the first two hours of incubation, and showed only a small increase of 1.18\% during the last 18 hours (Table \ref{tb:Paired_ttests}).


Haemolymph was withdrawn from the posterior adductor muscle of 9 adult mussels into an equal volume of methanol (n=3), 3:1 methanol:glacial acetic acid (n=3) or 5\% formaldehyde in \acrshort{mpss} (n=3) and fixed for 30 minutes in suspension. The fixed haemocytes were pelleted by centrifugation (250G, 5 min, \SI{20}{\celsius}) and resuspended in the eosin component of the Hemacolor\textsuperscript{\textregistered} kit. After staining for 5, 10 or 15 minutes, the stained haemocytes were pelleted (180G, 5 min, \SI{20}{\celsius}), resuspended in 100 \micro L Sorensen buffer and transferred onto glass slides. The slides were coverslipped and inspected under brightfield illumination on a Nikon Eclipse Ni-U upright microscope with a 40x/0.75 objective.

In some adult mussels, however, the basophilic and eosinophilic granulocyte subpopulations are partly overlapping with regard to internal complexity, i.e., SSC. Since the BD Accuri C6 Plus isn't equipped with adjustable laser gain settings, these subpopulations could not be separated further instrumentally. Thus, any attempts to gate on these subpopulations based solely on light scattering profiles, would in some mussels introduce considerable uncertainty into their relative proportions. [Find the proportion of mussels where they are not well separated, and report that number instead of saying "some" mussels here.]

This is where you write about your results in the context of what was expected, what others with similar experiments have found (in line with, contradictory, similar to). Put it together with other findings that may be relevant or interesting. The results are interpreted: what do they mean for the field, the risk assessors, the environmental risk of Ti2O, ZnO Ag NPs in the aquatic environment, Trondheimsfjorden. Extrapolate to a greater level of organization?. Put the results into a bigger context.


We should have withdrawn two samples from each mussel (as we did), but one into MPSS for staining with the Hemacolor kit and subsequant MN scoring (cold MPSS, 5 min inc in humid chamber) and one into ACB for FCM assays. With a bit dilution in MPSS and short incubation, neither aggregation nor spreading is a problem.

Haemolymph smears can be messy. Therefore, scoring of necrotic and apoptotic haemocytes by microscopy should be performed by certified operators with formal education or practice from hematology or immunology. A few example PNG images with from a published protocol leaves too much to subjectivity. Secondly, if they are rare events (e.g., low dose), why not score all 10 of 100.000 cells objectively by FCM instead of 0 or 1 from 1000 cells in the smear?
