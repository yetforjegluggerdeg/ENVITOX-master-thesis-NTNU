\section{The Model Organism/Study Animal}
Euryhaline, osmoconformer, closes valves in periods of exposure to brackish/fresh water (low tide), keeping the saline pallial/mantle fluid as the immediate surrounding environment. Becomes isosmotic with the pallial fluid (Gilles, 1972). In long exposures (> 75 hours) or by puncturing/keeping the valves prised they are forced to pump water, and the hemolymph rapidly conforms to the exterior osmolarity. Short said: is an osmoconformer that behaviorally protects itself from short-term exposures to hypo-osmotic conditions rather than physiologically (Davenport, 1979). Relevant for the osmolarity of buffers/solutions used.

\subsection{Classification of the haemocyte subpopulations of \emph{M. edulis}}
Since the early 1970s, several authors have devoted their attentions to developing a unifying classification system for the amoebocytic blood cells of bivalve mollusks, more commonly known as haemocytes (\cite{Cheng1980, delaBallina2022}). Belonging to the bivalve familiy \emph{Mytilidae}, the haemocytes of \emph{Mytilus edulis}, \emph{Mytilus galloprovincialis} and several other commercially important species of the genus \emph{Mytilus} have been encompassed by these efforts, creating a substantial pool of literature on the haemocytes of this genus alone. Despite a lack of consensus for any unifying classification system for the haemocytes of this phylum at large, the literature that exists on the haemocytes of \emph{M. edulis} is generally in agreement.

The first effort to classify the haemocytes of \emph{M. edulis} was made by Moore and Lowe (1977). Much like the other attempts to classify bivalve haemocytes at the time, this classification was based on the morphofunctional aspects of these cells - a system that has been extensively reviewed by Hine (1999). Moore and Lowe constructed a simple classification based on cytological and ultrastructural characteristics of the haemocytes, combined with their phagocytic capacities (\cite{Moore1977}), which is a immunological functional characteristic. From routine cytological staining, they identified three haemocyte subpopulations or cell types: "(1) small basophilic hyaline cells or lymphocytes, (2) larger basophilic hemocytes with varying degrees of irregular cytoplasmic granulation and vacuolation, and (3) eosinophilic granular haemocytes or granulocytes". These were postulated to make up two distinct growth series

[Continue by describing the cell types short, but in detail, since this has to be discussed relative to the other articles findings and my own findings.]

Functional classification by Cheng (1981) \cite{Cheng1984}.

Ontogeny by the use of monoclonal antibodies \cite{Noel1994} and \cite{Dyrynda1997}.

Conclude with something like this:
Except for a difference in terminology/naming, based on the ultra-structure and cytologic staining of these haemocytes and , they are referring to the same cell types.

Do not call the agranular cells for lymphocytes, because lymphocytes produce immunoglobulins. Blast-like cells are better, which are also referred to as lymphoid haemocytes, basophils, haemoblast-like or small hyalinocytes in various bivalve species.

Moore and Lowe (1977) Electron micrograph study
(1) small basophilic hyaline cells or lymphocytes
(2) larger basophilic hemocytes with varying degrees of irregular cytoplasmic granulation and vacuolation. More irregular shaped nucleus. Granules irregular in shape.
(3) eosinophilic granular hemocytes or granulocytes

Moreover, the small hyaline cells did not in general display any evidence of phagocytic activity, although some of the hemocytes of intermediate size did contain ingested carbon particles. On this basis, the basophilic cells have been subdivided into small non-phagocytic lymphocytes and larger phagocytic macrophages. 

Renwartz (1990) Internal defence system of Mytilus edulis \cite{Renwartz1990}
Confirmed the occurrence of two types of basophillic hemocytes: both small agranular cells and granular basophils, or so-called macrophages.

Pipe (1997) Percoll and electron microscopy and light microscopy (Wright's)
(1) mainly small agranular cells 
(2) granular cells with small granules (0.2-0.3 um)
(3) granulocytes with larger granules (0.5-1.5 um)

When taken together with light microscopy examinations, cell types 1 and 2 are both basopilic, and those with larger granules that separated out in the highest density layer are eosinopillic granulocytes.

Pipe (1990), Electron microscopy w/ lectin binding
Haemocytes fixed in suspension showed 3 basic types of ultrastructural morphology and were classified as:
(1) hyalinocytes
(2) granulocytes with small (0.2-0.3 um) granules
(3) granulocytes with large (0.5-1.5 um) granules

Rasmussen (1985), Electron and light microscopy (May Gr√ºnwald) \cite{Rasmussen1985}
The granulocytes had either acidophilic granules, basophilic granules, or a mixture of both. Could be divided into two populations:
Electron micrographs revealed granular and agranular hemocytes:
(1) Small granulocytes (6.9-8 um): lobulate nucleus, varying numbers of rather small round specific granules in the paranuclear cytoplasm. Had sometimes cytoplasmic protrusions (pseudopodia)
Large granulocyte (8-11 um): nucleus not lobulate, cytoplasm completely filled with specific granules, larger than those of the small granulocytes.
(3) Agranular hemocytes were very small (5.0-5.9 um) with an intense basophilic cytoplasm almost masking the nucleus (bean-shaped or lobulate).

Did not perform light microscopy examinations to confirm Wright's-Giemsa staining profiles.

Le Foll (2010), FCM and microscopy \cite{LeFoll2010}
(1) Basophils, some with a few large granules upon osmotic swelling
(2) Hyalinocytes, often spread cells, low N:C ratio, often clear vacuoles/phagosomes. (These are spread basophils). Cytoplasm barely visible.
(3) Eosinophilic granulocytes

Parisi (2008) Flow cytometry and light microscopy (Mytilus galloprovencialis)
Their FSC vs. SSC density plots revealed three distinct subpopulations (which was confirmed by light microscopy):
(1) agranular cells
(2) small granulocytes
(3) large granulocytes

Friebel and Renwratz (1995),

When the hemocytes of Mytilus edulis were stained with MG dye, all cells contained either basophilic or eosinophilic cytoplasm (Friebel and Renwartz, 1995). (Y) :)

\section{The role of hemocytes}
Hemocytes also (in addition to lung and digestive gland) showed high expression levels (of initiator and executioner caspases), probably due to the role of apoptosis in the defense against pathogens. Because bivalves are highly susceptible to climate changes, pollutants and pathogens, it  could be suggested that a strong apoptotic process may be necessary to ensure body homeostasis. (Romero, 2011). See page 11 of (New Insights into the Apoptotic Process in Mollusks: Characterization of Caspase Genes in Mytilus galloprovincialis) for greater detail and references.

Relocate the article about the role of hemocytes in wound-healing in mussels.

The total hemocyte count (THC) decreased by 66\% after a bacterial injection \cite{Parisi2008}. This could actually be to hemocyte aggregation in response to the needle injection itself.

\section{Bivalve hemocytes as \emph{in vivo} and \emph{in vitro} model systems}
Used as membrane integrity model system.

Introduce ToPro-3, Calcein AM (Calcein acetoxymethyl) and Apo-15 (\cite{Barth2020}) and their principle of staining, i.e., dye exclusion, cell-permeable (non-specific esterase substrate) and binding to phosphatidyl serine externalized during programmed cell death.

Theory behind Annexin-V/Apo-15: Annexin V
has affinity for phosphatidylserine, which is externalized to the
outer layer of the plasma membrane in the earlier stages of apoptosis. Annexin V also binds internal phosphatidylserine in permeable membranes, i.e. dead cells. Thus, dead cells are Apo-15+ ToPro3+, while the early apoptotiv cells are only Apo15+.
