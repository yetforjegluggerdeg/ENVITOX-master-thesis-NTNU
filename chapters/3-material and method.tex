\section{Method}
\subsection{Experimental setup/}
\emph{Mytilus edulis} (mean+-SD shell length cm and age?) were obtained from Snadder og Snaskum AS (Indre Fosen, Norway), transportation, that the supplier were asked not to shrub the shells, animal housing prior to experiment (erated, flow through volume, temperature, water type/source, time period, feeding, did they attach with byssus?), decribe depuration period

\subsection{Hemolymph sampling technique}
To minimize the possibility of contaminating hemolymph samples during extraction, a simple and time-effective sampling technique modified from the nonlethal technique of Gustafson et al., 2005 was developed. A "blind" method of withdrawal through a notch in the posterior dorsal shell or the exhalant syphon, frequently resulted in considerable contamination with debris from the pallial fluid or the lungs (data not shown). Therefore, the hemolymph sampling technique employed was centered around achieving good visual contact with the posterior adductor muscle and the position of the needle within the muscle during hemolymph withdrawal, and was mainly constricted by the requirement of an intact digestive gland.

The digestive gland is located dorsally (towards the hinge), slightly off-center towards the anterior end (Eggermont, 2020). In order to access and see the posterior adductor muscle while staying clear of the digestive gland, the valves were prised apart ventrally by gently forcing a tissue forceps between the valves midway of the mussel's length, or slightly posterior of the byssal mass (Fig. \ref{fig:Hemolymph_sampling_illustration}a). When the pallial cavity opened, pallial fluid (seawater) was drained away from the posterior adductor muscle by positioning the mussel's umbo on a paper tissue for 15-30 seconds. Since the posterior adductor muscle is oblong in the anteroposterior direction, penetrating the muscle from the posterior end pointing straight anteriorly gave the operator better margins to avoid piercing the muscle. To create a free path to the muscle from the posterior direction, the connecting mantle immediately surrounding the exhalant syphon where cut with a scalpel (Fig. \ref{fig:Hemolymph_sampling_illustration}b and d), holding the blunt spine of the scalpel blade facing the posterior adductor muscle.  Thus, when illuminating the pallial cavity from above with the ventral aspect facing upwards, the operator was able to supervise the position of the needle in the muscle sinus through the slightly transparent muscle fibers, as seen in Fig. \ref{fig:Hemolymph_sampling_illustration}c. The mussels were placed in the palm of the operator's non-dominant arm, 3$^{rd}$-5$^{th}$ digits firmly gripping the mussel, first and second digits holding the syringe steady in the anteroposterior direction, while the dominant arm were used to withdraw the syringe plunger.

Selection of buffer/medium and syringe:
Mention the hemocyte's tendency to aggregate upon mechanical stress from withdrawal, and the work that were done to test different anticoagulant solutions reported in the literature. 

Performed experiment to be able to report the mean slope of hemocyte concentration decrease over time from extraction (when using the different solutions and maybe 23G vs 27G needles?). 
Used fixed volume limit on FCM (30 uL/min), 250 uL hemolymph in 250 uL AA or ALS (1:1). Can report decrease in (se below) over time (t) from extraction:
- \% hemocytes of total events above 80.000 FSC treshold, since non-cell particles stay constant (doesn't aggregate)
- or \% aggregation as (Nt0-Ntx)/Nt0 (Hégaret, 2003)
- or just hemocyte concentration (per mL or uL)


Discuss the selection between 27G vs. 23G needles?:
- 23 Gauge:
Pro: The 23G needles had less aspiration resistance and and higher flow rates.
Con: The higher flow rates obtainable with 23G needles often drained the muscle sinus faster than hemolymph could flow from the posterior gastrointestinal arteries, creating negative pressure inside the muscle, which frequently disrupted of the muscle's structural integrity as a barrier and aspiration of air. Most of the times, once air had been aspired, it was difficult to withdraw more hemolymph.
Pro: Possibly less mechanical stress on the hemocytes during aspiration. [What is the name of the force that is exerted on a hemocyte during aspiration through a needle?] 
Con: Since the bevel-length of 23G needles were almost as long as the anteroposterior length of the posterior adductor muscles (mention size dist. of mussels), these needles were difficult to work with when sampling mussels in the size range of 4.0-4.5 cm (shell length).

27 gauge:
Con: More aspiration resistance --> slower.
Pro: Larger margins to the muscle boundaries and thus more control.
Pro: Less incidence of muscle negative pressure equalization.
Con?: Did hemocytes aspired by 27G needles aggregate faster than those aspired by 23G needles? Would be nice to affirm/debunk that question!



\subsection{Hemolymph Withdrawal/Extraction/Collection of hemolymph}
Using the method described above...
Technicalities of the withdrawal (1 mL syringes with 27 gauge hypodermic needles).
Syringe filled with 0.5 mL anticoagulant solution (ALS or AA).
[Should check if EDTA changes the cytogram, because it would be nice to report that it doesn't affect them.] 
Volume withdrawn, time used when aspirating these volumes
Dilution correction to 1:1 hemolymph:MAS after withdrawal if volume > 0.5 mL hemolymph. 
Hemolymph was not pooled or centrifuged (crude hemolymph). Report pH and osmolarity of the MAS buffer, and say that it is similar to the osmolarity of hemolymph/seawater 990 mOsm (Hartl, 2010)

\subsection{Determination of hemocyte concentration}
What did I use it for?
Concider including the experiment that was performed to validate the BD Accuri C6 Plus hemocyte counting technique with a technique using counting beads. Mention that a hemocytometer/counting chamber was used for the initial method development. It's a lot of data and work, which never looks bad. [Maybe not a separate subsection, but include under FCM or elsewere?]

\subsection{Flow Cytometry}
Flow Cytometer used and Flow Cytometry acquisition software
External software used for graphing and analysis of exported FCS files.
Replicate/triplicate measurements?
Number of events recorded for each mussel? ()
Briefly describe FCM and SSC.
Mention if data were collected in linear or logaritmic scale, 
FSC treshold (80.000 FSC-H)
Fluorescent compensation (matrix)
Describe gating strategy herein? Debris exclusion; doublet exclusion --> hemocytes. (Gating of basophils and eosinophils, FMO controls with TO-PRO-3 and the apoptosis stain).

\subsection{Assay Validation}
Both dead cell stain and apoptosis stain has to be validated. For TO-PRO-3 perform the same experiment with 70\% methanol-killed cells as you did for Calcein-AM + EthD-1, and use Calcein-AM to stain live cells.
How to do this for the Apo-stain?
