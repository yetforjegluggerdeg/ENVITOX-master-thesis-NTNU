\section{Method development}
This section describes in detail the work and experiments that were performed in the development of a hybrid flow cytometry- and microscopy-based version of The Mussel Micronucleus Cytome Assay by Bolognesi and Fenech (2012). The finalized assay is presented in it's entirety in the method section, in the context of it's application to test the potential genotoxic and cytotoxic effects of aged \ce{TiO2} and Ag engineered nanoparticles. The results from this section is presented in the Results chapter (\ref{section:Results_Method_Development}), and the reader can benefit from a read through that section before continuing with the method section and the main results (4.2).

\subsection{Haemolymph sampling technique}
To minimize the possibility of contaminating hemolymph samples during extraction, a simple and time-effective sampling technique adapted from the nonlethal technique of Gustafson et al., 2005 was used. "Blind" methods of withdrawal through a notch in the posterior dorsal shell or through the exhalant syphon frequently resulted in considerable contamination with debris from the pallial fluid. Therefore, the hemolymph sampling technique employed was centered around achieving good visual contact with the posterior adductor muscle and the position of the needle within the muscle during hemolymph withdrawal, and was mainly constricted by the requirement of an intact digestive gland.

The digestive gland is located dorsally (towards the hinge), slightly off-center towards the anterior end of the shell (Eggermont, 2020). In order to access and see the posterior adductor muscle while staying clear of the digestive gland, the valves were prised apart ventrally by gently forcing a tissue forceps between the valves midway of the mussel's length, or slightly posterior of the byssal mass (Fig. \ref{fig:Hemolymph_sampling_illustration}a). When the pallial cavity opened, pallial fluid (seawater) was drained away from the posterior adductor muscle by positioning the mussel's umbo on a paper tissue for 15-30 seconds. Since the posterior adductor muscle is oblong in the anteroposterior direction, penetrating the muscle from the posterior end pointing straight anteriorly gave the operator better margins to avoid piercing the muscle.

To create a free path to the muscle from the posterior direction, the connecting mantle immediately surrounding the exhalant syphon were cut with a scalpel (Fig. \ref{fig:Hemolymph_sampling_illustration}b and d), holding the blunt spine of the blade facing the posterior adductor muscle. Thus, when illuminating the pallial cavity from above with the ventral aspect facing upwards, the operator was able to supervise the position of the needle inside the posterior adductor muscle sinus through the slightly transparent muscle fibers, as seen in Fig. \ref{fig:Hemolymph_sampling_illustration}c.

For this work, 1.0 mL syringes equipped with sterile 23 gauge hypodermic needles were used. Hemolymph samples were gently withdrawn at an approximate rate of 1.0 mL/min, in order to prevent the negative pressure inside the muscle from drawing in pallial fluid between the muscle fibers. The mussels were placed in the palm of the operator's non-dominant arm, 3$^{rd}$-5$^{th}$ digits firmly gripping the mussel, 1$^{th}$ and 2$^{nd}$ digits keeping the syringe steady in the anteroposterior direction, while the dominant hand were used to withdraw the syringe plunger.

\subsection{Selection of haemocyte medium for flow cytometry assays}
The haemocytes of \emph{M. edulis} have a tendency to form aggregates upon mechanical stress, e.g. when the hemolymph is withdrawn through a thin syringe needle. Since accurate flow cytometric analyses rely on single-cell measurements, there was a need to minimize haemocyte aggregation during staining procedures, until the samples could by analyzed on the flow cytometer. In the literature, several authors have dealt with this challenge by aspirating hemolymph samples directly into slightly acidic EDTA-containing solutions buffered by citric acid (\cite{Söderhall1983, Bachere1988, LeFoll2010}). Since haemocyte aggregation is a Ca$^{2+}$-dependent process (\cite{Torreilles1999, Chen1995}), withdrawal of hemolymph into buffers containing divalent metal-ion chelators effectively slows the rate of haemocyte aggregation, allthough it does not inhibit aggregation completely (\cite{Chen1995}). Another frequently reported method is to dilute the hemolymph in cold filtered seawater (FSW), while keeping the samples on ice prior to analysis. 

In search for the most effective method for this work, hemolymph samples were withdrawn into syringes pre-filled with a number of different "anticoagulant" or "antiaggregative" buffers (1:1) reported in the literature. The degree of aggregation was initially evaluated by inspecting hemolymph smears prepared following the method of Bolognesi and Fenech (2012) under 10x magnification. After preliminary testing, the most promising buffers encountered where the Modified Alsever's Solution (MAS, pH=6.2), and the similar Anticoagulant Buffer (ACB, pH=7.6) with EDTA reported by \cite{Pipe1997}. Since the use of EDTA (MAS and ACB), acidic pH (MAS) or keeping samples on ice (FSW) might introduce inconveniences related to staining procedures, extra handling requirements and possibly impairing haemocyte viability, two experiments were devised in order to test their relative effects on haemocyte aggregation and viability - under the conditions intended for our flow cytometric analysis. Thereby, a cost-effect assessment could be carried out to arrive at the most suitable buffer for this work.

\subsubsection{Haemocyte aggregation}
An experiment was seeded from the observation that FCM singlet haemocyte counts tended to decrease over time from hemolymph withdrawal, and were based on the assumption that aggregation was the main driving factor. The proportion of aggregated haemocytes in a sample at a given time could therefore be retraced from the initial haemocyte count when performing several counts of the same sample over time. Since the difference in density between buffers would be negligible, the sedimentation rates would be independent of the haemocyte medium. Any observed differences would thus be caused by differences in the buffers' ability to inhibit aggregation.

500 \micro L hemolymph was withdrawn from 23 individual mussels into syringes prefilled with either 500 \micro L MAS (RT, n=7), ACB (RT, n=8) or cold Hemolymph Saline (MPSS, \SI{4}{\celsius}, n=8). Tris-buffered MPSS (pH=7.4) was used as a proxy for FSW, such that pH and osmolarity could be controlled. The diluted hemolymph was transferred to 12$\times$75 mm polystyrene tubes and the initial haemocyte count were determined by acquiring 20 \micro L sample on the flow cytometer immediately thereafter. Each sample was run with identical acquisition and fluidics settings (see table \ref{tb:FCM_settings}), and the cells were gated on by a singlet inclusion gate (FSC-A vs. FSC-H) and a haemocyte gate (FSC-A v. SSC-A, see gating strategy). To account for any extra aggregation occurring from gentle mixing with flow cytometry reagents in the planned assay, each sample was gently pipetted up and down four times following the initial count. The second count were performed precisely 15 minutes later to mimic the incubation periods of our flow cytometry reagents. Three more singlet haemocyte counts where acquired from each sample at 30, 45 and 60 minutes post-withdrawal, to discern the buffers' ability to prevent aggregation during longer incubation periods. Samples withdrawn into MPSS were kept on ice between each singlet haemocyte count.

\subsubsection{Logistic regression of the proportion of aggregated haemocytes}

The proportion of aggregated haemocytes where calculated according to equation \ref{eq: proportion_agg}.

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq: proportion_agg}
    \hat{p} = \dfrac{N_{t0} - N_{tx}}{(N_{t0} - N_{tx}) + N_{tx}} = \dfrac{N_{t0} - N_{tx}}{N_{t0}}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:agg_free_matrix}
    y = 
    \begin{pmatrix}
      N_{t0_{1}} - N_{tx_{1}} &  N_{t0_{1}} \\
      N_{t0_{2}} - N_{tx_{2}} &  N_{t0_{2}} \\
      N_{t0_{3}} - N_{tx_{3}} &  N_{t0_{3}} \\
      \vdots                   & \vdots       \\
      N_{t0_{n}} - N_{tx_{n}} &  N_{t0_{n}} \\
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
\
Where $\hat{p}$ is the proportion of aggregated haemocytes, N$_{to}$ is the initial number of singlet haemocytes in the sample and N$_{tx}$ is the number of singlet haemocytes at time x after hemolymph withdrawal. The proportion of aggregated haemocytes were modelled as a function of log time, with buffer as a categorical explanatory variable, using the base R glm() function with a "quasibinomial" error distribution and "logit" link function, as shown in Code listing 3.1. Instead of using the calculated proportions ($\hat{p}$), the response variable was formatted as a two-column matrix of aggregated and singlet haemocyte counts (see equation \ref{eq:agg_free_matrix}), such that logistic regression was possible. The logistic GLM model coded the categorical explanatory variable's factor levels into dummy variables (see equation \ref{eq:dummy_variables}), and used the MAS buffer as reference level. The resultant logistic model can be written out as in equation \ref{eq:logit} on the original scale, where $\alpha + \beta_{1}x_{i}$ is the linear predictor of the reference level, $\alpha_{2}$ and $\alpha_{3}$ are the difference in y-intercept for the MPSS and ACB buffers, while $\beta_{2}$ and $\beta_{3}$ are the differences in slopes for the same buffers, respectively. The data is presented in figure \ref{fig:aggregation}, together with the three buffers' "sub-models".

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R, caption = {The R source code run to fit the logistic proportion aggregation model.}]
model = glm(y ~ log(t) + Buffer + log(t):Buffer,
family = quasibinomial(link = "logit")
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:dummy_variables}
D_{2} =\begin{cases}
      1, & \text{MPSS}\\
      0, & \text{not MPSS},
    \end{cases}
    \quad
D_{3} =\begin{cases}
      1, & \text{ACB}\\
      0, & \text{not ACB}
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:logit}
\hat{p}_{i} = \dfrac{1}{1 + e^{-(\alpha \: + \: \beta_{1} x_{i} \: + \: \alpha_{2} D_{2} \: + \: \alpha_{3} D_{3} \: + \: \beta_{2} D_{2} \: + \: \beta_{3} D_{3} \: + \: \epsilon_{i})}}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Haemocyte viability}
One of the aims of this project was to count the number of necrotic haemocytes present in the hemolymph of \emph{M. edulis} by means of flow cytometry. Since the mussels were to be exposed to \ce{TiO2} and Ag nanoparticles \emph{in vivo} for 21 days, the targeted endpoint would be the number of necrotic haemocytes circulating in their hemolymph at the timepoint just before hemolymph extraction on day 22. Any acute effects on viability arising from the hemolymph extraction itself, or during incubation with the viability stains between extraction and count, would serve to obscure the potential \emph{in vivo} effect of the nanoparticles. When choosing a suitable anticoagulant buffer for the purpose of this measurement, is was therefore essential to make sure that the buffer itself did not interfere with the targeted endpoint.

To test wether the EDTA-containing buffers had any effects on haemocyte viability in the 15 minute time window required for staining, 500 \micro L hemolymph was withdrawn from 24 individual mussels into syringes prefilled with either 500 \micro L MAS (n=8) or ACB (n=8). Hemolymph from the last eight mussels were withdrawn into cold MPSS and kept on ice as negative EDTA-controls. The diluted hemolymph were transferred to 12$\times$75 mm polystyrene tubes, were they were stored for 15 minutes before staining 300 \micro L subsamples with 1.0 \micro L Calcein AM (50 \micro M) and 3.6 \micro L TO-PRO$^{TM}$-3 Iodide (100 \micro M) dissolved in DMSO. The samples were incubated in darkness for 15 minutes, before 10.000 haemocyte events were recorded on the flow cytometer without washing.

488 nm-exited green fluorescence from hydrolyzed Calcein were recorded on the FL1 detector with a 533/15 nm filter, while the 640 nm-exited far red fluorescence from DNA-bound TO-PRO$^{TM}$-3 Iodide were recorded on the FL4 detector with a 675/25 nm filter. The events were gated according to the gating strategy in figure (ref figure), obtaining counts of live (Calcein$^{+}$ToPro3$^{-}$), necrotic (Calcein$^{-}$ToPro3$^{+}$) and doubly stained (Calcein$^{+}$ToPro3$^{+}$) haemocytes, as well as non-cellular particles (Calcein$^{-}$ToPro3$^{-}$) and a total count. In this particular experiment the doubly stained haemocytes were counted as necrotic, as newly damaged or lysed haemocytes might still retain a degree of non-specific esterase activity. Hence, the percentage of necrotic haemocytes were calculated according to equation \ref{eq:necrotic hemocytes}.

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:necrotic hemocytes}
    \text{Necrotic haemocytes (\%)} = \dfrac{n_{Calcein^{-}ToPro3^{+}} + n_{Calcein^{+}ToPro3^{+}}}{n_{total} - n_{Calcein^{-}ToPro3^{-}}} \times 100
\end{equation}

The 700 \micro L remaining of each hemolymph sample were stored for another 2 and 20 hours, and the same staining and flow cytometric measurements were repeated at these timepoints. Because of considerable aggregation and sedimentation of haemocytes in MPSS after 2 and 20 hours, and those kept in MAS and ACB for 20 hours, the haemocytes in these samples were resuspended with a wide bore pipette before the second and third rounds of staining.

\subsection{Cytologic characterization of M.edulis haemocyte subpopulations}
\label{subsection:morph}
For the purpose of characterizing and imaging the different haemocyte cell types of \emph{M. edulis} in a non-spread state, samples were withdrawn into an equal volume of ice-cold MPSS and transferred directly onto glass slides. The glass slides were kept in a humid chamber for up to 5 minutes before cells were fixed in ice cold methanol (5$\times$ 1 sec dips). This assured haemocyte attachment, but circumvented the profound morphological changes accompanied by the haemocytes’ process of spreading. Slides were stained with the Hemacolor\textsuperscript{\textregistered} kit according to the manufacturer’s recommendations, air dried, mounted with Eukitt\textsuperscript{\textregistered} and coverslipped. Stained haemocytes were examined and imaged under brightfield illumination on a Nikon Eclipse 90i upright microscope with a 100$\times$/1.40 oil immersion objective and a Nikon DS-Fi1 microscope camera.

Haemocyte morphology was primarily characterized on the basis of cytoplasmic staining, granularity (granule size, abundance and staining affinities), nuclear:cytoplasmic (N:C) ratio, size and shape. Since Le Foll and colleagues (2010) reported that the motile properties of the different haemocyte subpopulations of \emph{M. edulis} could be used as an additional functional criteria for their characterization, the spreading behavior of the different cell types were included to expand on the morphological characteristics. This comprehended a description of the typical haemocyte shapes and motile structures that were observable under differential interference contrast illumination in spread haemocytes. The preparation of slides with spread haemocytes followed a methodology similar to that of the non-spread haemocytes, but the humid chamber incubation periods prior to fixation and staining were extended (15-30 min). Microscopic fields were examined through a 60$\times$/1.40 oil immersion objective under DIC illumination.

\subsection{Determination of cell diameters}
\label{subsection:CytCar}
To establish wether haemocyte subpopulations differed with regard to size across a larger population of adult mussels, the cell diameters of 100 haemocytes were ascertained in haemolymph smears from 20 individual mussels (n=2000). Since the rate and degree of haemocyte spreading could be inherently different among cell types, all spreading was effectively impeded by collecting haemolymph samples into an equal volume of 5\% formaldehyde in MPSS. The fixation was continued for one hour in suspension, before cells were pelleted by centrifugation (250G, 15 min, \SI{10}{\celsius}) and resuspended in 100 \micro L 0.75 \% eosin in Sorensen Buffer. After staining for 5 minutes, 1 mL 3\% Wright’s-Giemsa was added and the staining was continued for an additional 15 minutes. Stained haemocytes were pelleted by centrifugation (180G, 12 min, \SI{10}{\celsius}), resuspended in 100-200 \micro L Sorensen Buffer and transferred onto glass slides. The slides were air-dried in a fume hood until the smears were completely dry and transparent, before they were mounted with Eukitt\textsuperscript{\textregistered} and coverslipped.

The slides were placed on the stage of a Nikon Eclipse 80i upright microscope, and 10-20 microscopic fields from each smear was photographed under DIC illumination with a $\times$60 oil immersion objective. Cell diameter measurements were performed digitally, using the \emph{Straight line tool} of the ImageJ image processing software (NIH, Bethesda, Maryland, US). The actual size of the magnified haemocytes were determined by calibrating the software's pixel/\micro m scale with a stage micrometer calibration slide (Leitz Wetzlar, Buffalo, DE), photographed with the same equipment and image resolution as the haemolymph smears. When haemocyte outlines deviated from an approximate spherical shape, the diameter was estimated as the average length of the long and short axes, after Burkhard et al. (2009). The measurements were performed as differential counts, such that the number of measurements of each cell type reflected their average relative proportions (\%) across all 20 mussels.

In order to


\subsubsection{Isopycnic centrifugation}
Formaldehyde-fixed haemocytes were separated on discontinuous Percoll gradients according to the protocol by Friebel and Renwrantz (1995), with minor modifications. The separation was performed in duplicate with pooled haemocytes from a total of six adult mussels (shell length 55-70 mm). For both gradients, the haemolymph of three individual mussels (1.5-2.0 mL/mussel) were withdrawn into an equal volume of 5\% formaldehyde in MPSS, wherein the haemocytes were fixed for one hour after pooling. The fixed haemocytes were stained with 0.75 \% Eosin and 3 \% Giemsa according to the procedure in section~\ref{subsection:CytCar}. After pelleting, stained haemocytes were resuspended in Tris-Buffered Saline (TBS, 900 mOsm) to an approximate concentration of $9\times10^{6}$ cells/mL, before layering 2 mL suspension on top of both gradients. Discontinuous Percoll gradients consisted of 15\%, 33\%, 38\%, 43\% and 90\% Percoll stock in TBS (vol/vol), and were constructed by carefully layering 2 mL of each Percoll concentration in 15 mL Falcon centrifuge tubes with conical bottoms (Corning, New York, US).

The centrifugation was started at 120G for 10 minutes (\SI{4}{\celsius}), followed by 40 minutes at 2500G. An Eppendorf 5804 R benchtop centrifuge equipped with an A-4-44 swing-bucket rotor was employed for the separation, with the brake ramp set to 1. The separated cell fractions were collected into syringes by puncturing the tubes below the gradient interfaces with 23G hypodermic needles. According to a protocol by Bachére and Grizel (1988), the Percoll was eliminated from the 43/90\% and 38/43\% fractions by two consecutive dilutions in TBS (1:7) and a 10\% sucrose cushions (1:1) before centrifugation (800G, 15 min, \SI{4}{\celsius}). Haemocytes collected from the 15/33\% interface were centrifuged directly after a seven-fold dilution in TBS (800G, 15 min, \SI{4}{\celsius}).

The pelleted cell fractions were resuspended in Sorensen buffer and divided into two aliquots; one aliquot were used to prepare smears according to the procedure in section \ref{subsection:CytCar}, while the remaining aliquots were further diluted in 1 mL Sorensen buffer for flow cytometric characterization. A total of 10.000 events were acquired from each cell fraction on the flow cytometer (36 \micro L flow rate, 16 \micro m core size), in addition to 30.000 events from both pools that were set aside prior to centrifugation. The relative proportion (\%) of cell types in each fraction were ascertained by performing 1000-cell differential counts.

\subsubsection{Identification of eosinophilic granulocytes by SSC and eosin fluorescence}
Since Eosin is fluorescent in the green/yellow spectrum (Ex$_{max}$/Em$_{max}$: 517/543 nm) (\cite{Koegle2020}), blue laser-exited fluorescence from this anionic dye can be collected on the FL1 detector (518-548 nm) of the BD Accuri C6 Plus flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, California, US). If the haemocytes of \emph{M. edulis} are permeabilized and stained with eosin prior to flow cytometric analysis, the fluorescent signal from Eosin can be used to identify eosinophilic granulocytes on FSC vs. SSC dotplots by backgating. This approach was attempted by Le Foll an colleagues (2010), who detached spread haemocytes stained by eosin with an EDTA/trypsin solution followed by flow cytometric analysis. As noted in the theory section (\ref{subsection:haemocyte_classification}), their results indicated that FL1$^{bright}$ events corresponded to haemocytes with high SSC values. However, this exact methodology did not result in two well-defined FL1$^{bright}$ and FL1$^{dim}$ peaks, such that the lower bound of their electronic FL1$^{bright}$ gate had to be drawn more or less arbitrarily. It could therefore not be used to quantify the proportion of eosinophilic haemocytes - especially since the identity of the FL1$^{bright}$ events were never verified by microscopy.

To investigate the potential application of eosin fluorescence and side scatter as discriminators in a flow cytometric differential count of \emph{M. edulis} haemocytes, an attempt to optimize the basic method of Le Foll et al. (2010) were undertaken. This process involved exploring different fixatives, methods of fixation, eosin staining solutions and the duration of both fixation and staining, in order to achieve a practically applicable resolution between eosinophilic granulocytes and the rest of the haemocytes.

Haemolymph was withdrawn from the posterior adductor muscle of 9 adult mussels into an equal volume of methanol (n=3), 3:1 methanol:glacial acetic acid (n=3) or 5\% formaldehyde in MPSS (n=3) and fixed for 30 minutes in suspension. The fixed haemocytes were pelleted by centrifugation (250G, 5 min, \SI{20}{\celsius}) and resuspended in the eosin component of the Hemacolor\textsuperscript{\textregistered} kit. After staining for 5, 10 or 15 minutes, the stained haemocytes were pelleted (180G, 5 min, \SI{20}{\celsius}), resuspended in 100 \micro L Sorensen buffer and transferred onto glass slides. The slides were coverslipped and inspected under brightfield illumination on a Nikon Eclipse Ni-U upright microscope with a 40x/0.75 objective.

The only smears without high degrees of unspecific binding were those fixed in 5\% formaldehyde. To reduce the passive diffusion of eosin into non-target cells, 5\% formaldehyde in MPSS was selected for further testing - being the softest fixative of the three. By diluting Eosin in Sorensen buffer, a set of staining solutions with 0.25\%, 0.5\%, 0.75\%, 1.0\%, 1.5\%, 3\%, 5\%, and 8\% Eosin (vol/vol) were prepared. The haemolymph of 4 new mussels where fixed in 5\% formaldehyde for 30 minutes, pooled and st 

\subsection{Scoring of necrotic haemocytes by flow cytometry}
To discriminate between viable and necrotic haemocytes by flow cytometry, a two-color fluorescence assay with the cell-permeant probe Calcein acetoxymethyl and the non-permeant dsDNA-binding dye TO-PRO$^{TM}$-3 Iodide (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was chosen. This combination of probes was primarily selected for two reasons: (1) it enables simultaneous measurement of intracellular esterase activity and plasma membrane integrity - two recognized parameters of cell viability, and (2) there is virtually no fluorescent spillover between the probes, such that the uncompensated raw data can be used directly.

Since Calcein AM is commonly used in the LIVE/DEAD\textsuperscript{\textregistered} Viability/Cytotoxicity Kit for mammalian cells (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), the staining protocol of this kit was used as a guide for obtaining an adequate fluorescent signal from hydrolyzed Calcein on the FL1 detector (518-548 nm). The manufacturer's recommendation of 50 nM Calcein AM mL$^{-1}$ cell suspension (0.1-5 $\times 10^{6}$ cells) gave a bright fluorescent signal in live cells after 15 minute incubation, so no further optimization was required. Information on suitable concentrations of TO-PRO$^{TM}$-3 Iodide for flow cytometric dye exclusion tests was however sparse, such that this had to be determined experimentally.

\subsubsection{Determination of optimal TO-PRO$^{TM}$-3 Iodide staining concentration}
The optimal TO-PRO$^{TM}$-3 Iodide concentrations for a flow cytometric dye exclusion assay would ideally fulfill two requirements. The first would be to give the highest possible resolution between viable and necrotic cells in terms of fluorescent intensity. Secondly, and of equal importance; the concentration cannot be acutely cytotoxic to haemocytes within the time-frame of staining and flow cytometric acquisition. To determine a suitable range of concentrations for this assay, a pool of dead (70\% methanol 30 min) and freshly withdrawn haemocytes was prepared. The methanol-killed hameocytes were washed three times in MPSS, resuspended ACB and gently mixed with freshly withdrawn heamocytes in ACB. The suspension was divided into 11 aliquotes of 1 mL, and all but one was stained with TO-PRO$^{TM}$-3 in the range of 30 nM to 8 \micro M. After incubating for 15 minutes (protected from light), 10 000 events were acquired from each sample on the flow cytometer. To examine wether the fluorescent signal intensity increased with further incubation, the same samples were incubated for another 15 minutes before the measurement was repeated.

Red laser-exited fluorescence from dsDNA-bound TO-PRO$^{TM}$-3 Iodide was collected on the FL4 detector (675/25 nm) of the BD Accuri C6 Plus flow cytometer. A histogram representation of the fluorescence revealed two distinct populations of events: one population of ToPro3$^{-}$ events and one population of ToPro3$^{+}$ events. The mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) of the two populations were calculated for each aliquot, and the difference was plotted against the staining-concentrations of TO-PRO$^{TM}$-3 Iodide. In order to predict a suitable range of concentrations from the data, the MFI differences were regressed on the TO-PRO$^{TM}$-3 concentration using a log-logistic model. Since the data required a model range bound by 0 and some unknown positive integer (0, \emph{a}), a four-parameter log-logistic function from the remote drc() package was used (v3.0-1; \cite{drc}). This function allows the lower asymptote to be fixed to 0, as shown in code listing 3.2. The general function is seen in (\ref{eq:LL4}), where \emph{b} and \emph{e} represents the slope parameter and inflection point, while \emph{d} and \emph{c} represents the upper and lower asymptotes, respectively.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R, caption = {The R source code run to fit the four-parameter log-logistic regression model in RStudio.}]
model = drm(y ~ x, data = df, fct = LL.4(fixed = c(NA, 0, NA, NA), 
names = c("b", "c", "d", "e")))
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:LL4}
y_{i} = c + \dfrac{d-c}{1 + (x_i / e)^b} + \epsilon_i
\end{equation}

Potential cytotoxicity at high concentrations was evaluated by examining the ToPro3$^{-}$ populations (SSC vs. FL4), to see wether any of the freshly withdrawn haemocytes were starting loose their ability to exclude TO-PRO$^{TM}$-3 Iodide.

Adult blue mussels (\emph{Mytilus edulis}) of x.x$\pm{5}$ cm shell length were obtained from Snadder og Snaskum AS (Indre Fosen, Norway). Upon arrival at the marine animal housing facilities of NTNU, Centre of Fisheries and Aquaculture (SeaLab), the mussels were transferred to 50 L filtered seawater flow-through tanks (11 L/min) supplied by a direct inlet from Trondheimsfjorden at 80 m depth ($\SI{7.5}{\celsius}$). Here, the mussels were kept to acclimatize for 2 days before transfer to the experimental exposure setup.
