\section{Method}
\subsection{Animal housing}
Adult blue mussels (\emph{Mytilus edulis}) of x.x$\pm{5}$ cm shell length were obtained from Snadder og Snaskum AS (Indre Fosen, Norway). Upon arrival at the marine animal housing facilities of NTNU, Centre of Fisheries and Aquaculture (SeaLab), the mussels were transferred to 50 L filtered seawater flow-through tanks (11 L/min) supplied by a direct inlet from Trondheimsfjorden at 80 m depth ($\SI{7.5}{\celsius}$). Here, the mussels were kept to acclimatize for 2 days before transfer to the experimental exposure setup.

Time of mussel harvest/purchase?

Describe water treatment in more detail: include information regarding sand-filter, protein-skimmer, 0.5 um filter bags and UV-treatment.

Because the watertreatment left no natural feed for the mussels, the filtered seawater were suplemented with algea (species) [frequency]


\subsection{Experimental setup/design}
- Specs related to flowrate, feeding (alge conc: Coulter counter), how often was nano particles changed (every 3-4 days: check article), concentrations (ICP-MS --> mg/L in stocks and exp tanks), zetasizer --> size and surface potential

include figure of exp setup?

depuration period: check article

storage from depuration to sampling: mussels were not kept on ice, but were washed and taken directly upstairs for measuring weight, length, height and width for condition index, and were given to us for FCM sampling afterwards. If we were delayed, they were kept in the fridge until hemolymph sampling 


\subsection{Hemolymph collection}
By employing the sampling technique described above, 0.5 mL hemolymph was withdrawn from each mussel into 1.0 mL syringes pre-filled with 0.5 mL anticoagulant buffer (ACB).

- Hemolymph was not pooled or centrifuged. 

\subsection{Determination of hemocyte concentration and subpopulations}
"The total hemocyte concentration, morphometry and definition of sub-populations were determined using side scatter (SSC) and forward scatter (FSC) light. Side scatter light corresponds to the relative internal complexity or granularity of the cells and FSC corresponds to the relative cell size" \cite{Rolton2020}


Concider including the experiment that was performed to validate the BD Accuri C6 Plus hemocyte counting technique with a technique using counting beads. Mention that a hemocytometer/counting chamber was used for the initial method development. It's a lot of data and work, which never looks bad. [Maybe not a separate subsection, but include under FCM or elsewere?]

\subsection{Cytologic characterization and haemocyte differential} 
For the purpose of characterizing and capturing the cell types in  \emph{Mytilus edulis} haemolymph in a non-spread state, samples were withdrawn into an equal volume of ice-cold MPSS and transferred directly onto glass slides. The glass slides were kept in a humid chamber for up to 5 minutes before cells were fixed in ice cold methanol (5 $\times$ 1 sec dips). This assured haemocyte attachment, but circumvented the profound morphological changes accompanied by the haemocytes' process of spreading. Slides were stained with the Hemacolor\textsuperscript{\textregistered} kit according to the manufacturer's recommendations, air dried, mounted with Eukitt\textsuperscript{\textregistered} and coverslipped. Stained haemocytes were examined and imaged under brightfield illumination by a $\times$100 oil immersion objective with 1.40 numerical aperture and a Nikon DS-Fi1 microscope camera. The preparation of spread haemocytes followed the same methodology, but the cells were incubated for 15-30 minutes in a humid chamber, and microscopic fields were imaged under differential interference contrast (DIC) illumination by a $\times$60 oil immersion objective with 1.40 numerical aperture.

In order to determine the relative proportions (\%) of cell types in untreated mussels, a differential was performed by counting a minimum of 1000 haemocytes in each of 20 untreated mussels. On the basis of their cytoplasmic granules (or the lack thereof), they where placed one in of three categories: eosinophilic granulocytes, basophilic granulocytes or [hyaline blast-like basophils]. Aggregation can obscure cell type identification and the counting of single haemocytes, such that clumped haemocytes cannot be included in differentials. In addition, clumping seemed to be more severe among basophillic haemocytes, such that an exclusion of clumped haemocytes could potentially skew the differential. To bypass this problem, haemolymph was withdrawn into an equal volume of 5 \% formaldehyde in MPSS, and fixed in suspension for 1 hour. Haemocytes were pelleted by centrifugation (250G, 15 min, \SI{10}{\celsius}) and resuspended in 100 \micro L 0.75 \% eosin in Sørensen Buffer. After staining for 5 minutes, 1 mL 3 \% Wright's-Giemsa was added and the haemocytes were stained for another 15 minutes. The stained haemocytes were pelleted (180G, 12 min, \SI{10}{\celsius}), resuspended in 100-200 \micro L Sørensen Buffer and transferred onto glass slides. The slides were air-dried in a fume hood until the smears were completely dry and transparent, before they were mounted with Eukitt\textsuperscript{\textregistered} and coverslipped.

Since the rate and degree of spreading could be inherently different among the three cell types, measuring cell diameters of spread haemocytes \emph{in vitro} could possibly infer size differences that were not reflective of their "real" size distributions when suspended in haemolymph \emph{in vivo}. To remove the factor of haemocyte-spreading from the equation, the size distributions were determined using the formaldehyde-fixed samples from the differential, where the cells had been fixed in suspension prior to smearing. Performed during the differential, 10-20 random microscopic fields per mussel were imaged under DIC illumination by a $\times$60 oil immersion objective, and diameters were measured using the straight line tool of the ImageJ image processing software (NIH, Bethesda, Maryland, US). Haemocytes were measured one by one, image by image, until the diameters of a total of 100 haemocytes had been ascertained per mussel. When a haemocyte's outline deviated from an approximate spherical shape, the diameter was estimated as the average length of it's long and short axes.

\end{table}

\subsection{Slide preparation}
Refer to the MN cytome assay by Bolognesi, and mention that we fixed and stained hemocytes in suspension to produce slides without aggregated hemocytes. Since the cells were dead, they did not spread or produce pseudopodia, which allowed us to observe the actual size and form which they would posses ass they flowed through the laser of the flow cytometer.

\subsection{Assay Validation}
Both dead cell stain and apoptosis stain has to be validated. For TO-PRO-3 perform the same experiment with 70\% methanol-killed cells as you did for Calcein-AM + EthD-1, and use Calcein-AM to stain live cells.
How to do this for the Apo-stain?
