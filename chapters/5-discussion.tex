\label{chap:discuss}

This is where you write about your results in the context of what was expected, what others with similar experiments have found (in line with, contradictory, similar to). Put it together with other findings that may be relevant or interesting. The results are interpreted: what do they mean for the field, the risk assessors, the environmental risk of Ti2O, ZnO Ag NPs in the aquatic environment, Trondheimsfjorden. Extrapolate to a greater level of organization?. Put the results into a bigger context.
